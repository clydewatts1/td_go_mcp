  Ask each team member to share:

  1. **What did you work on yesterday?**
     - Please describe the main tasks you completed
     - Highlight any significant progress or achievements

  2. **What will you work on today?**
     - Outline your planned tasks and priorities
     - Mention any important deadlines or milestones

  3. **Are there any blockers or impediments?**
     - Share any obstacles preventing your progress
     - Identify anything you need help with from the team

  Remember to:
  - Keep updates brief and focused
  - Focus on work relevant to the team
  - Speak up if you can help unblock someone
  - Save detailed technical discussions for after the standup

  Let's start with the first team member!
